  "readme": "Moodle Assister\n===============\n\nMoodle Assister (mdl) is a convenience tool to aid moodle development. It\nallows use of different versions of JavaScript tools used in the different\nversions of Moodle.\n\n\nWhat's it for?\n--------------\n\nSince Moodle 2.5, we've started to run out JavaScript code through a\nvariety of tools to give such joys as correctly linted, and minified\nJavaScript, with reusable meta-data.\n\nGiven that these tools are used to build code which is then included in\nour repositories, we need to ensure that we can have repeatable builds\nacross different branches. So if the build method changes between tool\nversion A and version B and this leads to differences in the built code, we\nneed to ensure that we continue building the same code for all versions of\nMoodle which were previously built using tool version A.\n\n\nHow does that work?\n-------------------\n\nWhen a new version of Moodle is branched, a new version of the mdl-sub tool\nshould also be branched capturing the dependencies for that version of\nMoodle. The name is also updated to reflect the version of Moodle it\ncorresponds to.\n",
